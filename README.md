# RallyLang
RallyLang is a very simplistic interpretation of a programming language using rally pace notes. 
This style of "hiding" a language within text that looks like something else is inspired by the language Chef. 
The following syntax may not match what your pacenotes exactly as everybody's notes may be slightly different. 
Over time the syntax may evolve slightly, so if for some reason you find yourself messing around with RallyLang 
please check for updates after pulling the latest version. 

## Syntax
The following will be populated with the syntax after more is defined. Right now only simple text output is 
support in order to create a Hello World example. For now you can look at the 'Test Files/HelloWorldCommented.txt'
for a rough idea of how things work. Again, this is subject to change.

## Why?
Why would I create this language with seamingly no true usage? Well, for fun of course. I thought this would 
be a fun opportunity to try and combine motorsports with programming. This baby transpiler is more of a fun
learning experience than anything else. I hope you find it at least comical or interesting. 

## Plans
The current plans for this are to just support simplistic loops, conditionals, integer and double math, and string
manipulation. Outside of that I have no major plans. Currently the interpretation only supports a total of 12 unique
variables and I don't see that part changing. I doubt anybody will ever find this truly useful, but that's okay.
